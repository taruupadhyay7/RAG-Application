RAG Project
🚀 Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which combines:

Document Retrieval → Fetches the most relevant information from a knowledge base.

Text Generation → Uses a language model to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

This allows the system to answer questions based on custom documents, making responses more reliable, explainable, and source-grounded.

 Features:

📄 Upload and process custom documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)

🔍 Semantic search using embeddings

🤖 Question Answering powered by LLM

⚡ Fast and efficient retrieval pipeline
